Welcome to ForageCraft! This mod aims to make survival mode easier by giving various blocks extra drops.

For example:

Carrots and potatoes can be found in grass blocks  
Pumpkin and melon seeds can be found in tall grass  
Ancient bones can be dug up from the dirt  
Leaves now drop some sticks  
These are just a few examples, there are several more for you to find. Additionally, this mod also adds a crafting recipe to turn skulls into bone meal, and also allows you to cook PLANT poisonous potatoes!

Enjoy foraging :)
